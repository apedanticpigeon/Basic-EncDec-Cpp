## BASIC CRYPTOGRAPHY IMPLEMENTATION IN C++ (EncdecCP2)üë®üèª‚Äçüíª
<li><b>Tags:</b> Ciphers/Encryption Algorithms, Self-learning, C++
<li><b>Description:</b> This is my first project in C++ to emulate the working mechanisms behind the modern encryption algorithms (e.g. Caesar Cipher [monoalphabetic substitution], Vigen√®re Cipher [polyalphabetic substitution]) with the necessary minimisation of debugging with the assistance of AI, in-built functions over time program after program, and thorough explanations for each line of code that are seemingly complicated to a beginner like myself followed with a writeup for the next few encdec programs. 
<li><b>Scope:</b> The project may be active during periods when I have (1) completed most of my university assignments (2) finished studying/researching other topics relevant to Q.M., (3) planned school tasks ahead of my time and accomplish them (4) during holidays.
<li>Requirements: (1) Must be completed before starting GammaCRust. (2) Decrease use of in-built functions if it's the 'common method' for some procedures
<li>Notices: The programs in this repository may lack some functionalities regarding to the I/O loop during invalid input, because the focus is perfecting the blocks of code for the encoding algorithm without much regard on user experience (for now).

*It is not an 'encoding algorithm' but I like to try programming it in C++. It has been done by IBM, but it is in Python.
